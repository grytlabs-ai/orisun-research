# Category Positioning

**Where Decision Intelligence Infrastructure Sits**

---

## The Category Landscape

The market contains many overlapping categories. This document positions decision intelligence infrastructure relative to adjacent and competing frames.

---

## Adjacent Categories (Not Competitors)

### Business Intelligence (BI)
**What it is:** Visualization and analysis of data for insight.

**Relationship to Decision Intelligence:**
- BI answers "What happened?" and "What does the data show?"
- Decision Intelligence answers "What should we decide?" and "Why?"
- BI is an input layer; Decision Intelligence is an action layer
- They complement; they don't compete

**Key distinction:** BI produces insight. Decision Intelligence produces defensible positions.

---

### Workflow / Project Management
**What it is:** Organization of tasks, timelines, and status.

**Relationship to Decision Intelligence:**
- Workflow manages what's being done
- Decision Intelligence manages why it was chosen
- Workflow tracks completion; Decision Intelligence tracks judgment
- They operate at different levels of abstraction

**Key distinction:** Workflow asks "Is it done?" Decision Intelligence asks "Was it right?"

---

### GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)
**What it is:** Management of controls, evidence, and compliance posture.

**Relationship to Decision Intelligence:**
- GRC catalogs requirements and evidence
- Decision Intelligence interprets and applies them
- GRC is often retrospective (audit support)
- Decision Intelligence is real-time (decision support)
- GRC tools can feed Decision Intelligence systems

**Key distinction:** GRC asks "Are we compliant?" Decision Intelligence asks "What's the right interpretation?"

---

### Knowledge Management
**What it is:** Capture and retrieval of organizational knowledge.

**Relationship to Decision Intelligence:**
- Knowledge Management stores what's known
- Decision Intelligence applies it to decisions
- Knowledge is an input; judgment is the process
- Both require structured representation

**Key distinction:** Knowledge Management preserves information. Decision Intelligence produces reasoning.

---

## Overlapping Categories (Partial Competitors)

### Decision Management / Decision Automation
**What it is:** Rule-based systems for automated decisions.

**Overlap:**
- Both focus on decisions as the unit of value
- Both require structured representation

**Difference:**
- Decision Management assumes rules can fully specify decisions
- Decision Intelligence assumes human judgment is essential
- Decision Management automates; Decision Intelligence augments

**Competitive dynamic:** Decision Management is a subset. Works for automatable decisions. Insufficient for judgment-heavy domains.

---

### AI Assistants / Copilots
**What it is:** General-purpose AI interfaces for task assistance.

**Overlap:**
- Both use AI to support human work
- Both can answer questions and generate content

**Difference:**
- Assistants are general-purpose; Decision Intelligence is domain-structured
- Assistants generate; Decision Intelligence reasons with authority
- Assistants lack provenance; Decision Intelligence is audit-ready
- Assistants always answer; Decision Intelligence refuses when appropriate

**Competitive dynamic:** Assistants are entry point. Decision Intelligence is destination. Users often start with assistants and discover they need more.

---

### Agentic AI Platforms
**What it is:** Infrastructure for autonomous AI agents.

**Overlap:**
- Both represent the next layer of AI infrastructure
- Both go beyond simple chat interfaces

**Difference:**
- Agents optimize for autonomy; Decision Intelligence optimizes for accountability
- Agents act; Decision Intelligence supports judgment
- Agents may obscure reasoning; Decision Intelligence requires transparency

**Competitive dynamic:** Agents are one architectural choice. Decision Intelligence is another. They may converge or remain distinct depending on governance requirements.

---

## Direct Competitors (Same Problem)

### Decision Operating Systems
A small number of emerging products directly target decision infrastructure:

**Convoking4**
- Focus: Decision → project governance for scaling companies
- Strength: Explicit decision structure; execution connection
- Gap: Not fully AI-native; less focus on authority-anchoring

**PRISM OS**
- Focus: Leader workspace for priorities and judgment
- Strength: Graduation/independence design; AI-native
- Gap: Personal tool, not organizational substrate

**Dispatch**
- Focus: Decision throughput for executives
- Strength: Workflow integration; speed
- Gap: Inbox-centric; not governance-grade

### Assessment
The direct competitor set is small and differentiated. No clear market leader. Category is still forming.

---

## Where Decision Intelligence Infrastructure Sits

### The Unique Position

Decision Intelligence Infrastructure occupies the intersection of:

1. **Decision focus** (like Decision Management)
2. **AI-native architecture** (like modern AI platforms)
3. **Governance requirements** (like GRC)
4. **Authority-anchoring** (unique)
5. **First-class refusal** (unique)
6. **Structural learning** (unique)

No existing category fully covers this combination.

### The Subcategory Thesis

Decision Intelligence Infrastructure is best understood as a **new subcategory** emerging from the intersection of:

- Decision operating systems
- AI-native reasoning platforms
- Governance infrastructure

It is distinguished by two requirements not found elsewhere:
1. **Schema/logic guidance** instead of advice
2. **Explicit graduation/independence** as a design goal

---

## Positioning Statement

**For** organizations making consequential decisions under uncertainty,

**Who** need their AI tools to be defensible, authority-anchored, and accountable,

**Decision Intelligence Infrastructure** is a new category of AI-native systems

**That** captures decisions, traces authority, refuses when uncertain, and learns structurally,

**Unlike** workflow tools (which track tasks), GRC platforms (which catalog compliance), or AI assistants (which generate without governance).

## Market Entry Implications

### Naming
The category name matters. Options:

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| Decision Intelligence | Existing term (Gartner); clear | Often means dashboards |
| Decision Infrastructure | Clear; substrate emphasis | Less familiar |
| Judgment Infrastructure | Unique; human-centered | May sound soft |
| Governance-Grade AI | Clear positioning | Narrow |
| AI-Native Decision OS | Comprehensive | Jargon-heavy |

**Recommendation:** Use "Decision Intelligence Infrastructure" for precision. Accept that education is required.

### Buyer Education
The market does not yet fully understand this category. Positioning requires:
- Clear distinction from adjacent categories
- Concrete examples of what it enables
- Honest acknowledgment of what it doesn't do
- Proof points (demos, case studies, research)

### Timing
The category is early. This is both opportunity (define the terms) and risk (market may not yet be ready). 

First-mover advantage is less important than correctness. The entity that builds right—not first—will lead.
