# Market Audit: The Decision Intelligence Gap

**Why AI-Native Requires New Infrastructure**

---

## Executive Summary

The market for "AI operating systems," "decision platforms," and "execution infrastructure" is crowded with terminology and sparse with structural solutions.

Most products claiming these labels organize **tasks, data, or workflows**—not **decisions, authority, and judgment**.

This audit identifies what exists, what's missing, and where the gap creates opportunity.

**Conclusion:** Decision intelligence infrastructure represents a new subcategory—not a crowded market—distinguished by requirements that existing solutions do not meet.

## What Exists Today

### Category 1: Workflow & Project Management

**Examples:** Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Notion, Linear

**What they do:**
- Organize tasks and projects
- Track status and deadlines
- Enable collaboration
- Provide visibility into work

**What they don't do:**
- Capture decisions or reasoning
- Anchor to authority or compliance
- Preserve accountability chains
- Learn from judgment outcomes

**Assessment:** Strong at execution visibility. Silent on decision intelligence.

---

### Category 2: GRC Platforms (Governance, Risk, Compliance)

**Examples:** ServiceNow GRC, Archer, LogicGate, AuditBoard, Hyperproof

**What they do:**
- Manage controls and evidence
- Track compliance requirements
- Organize risk assessments
- Support audit workflows

**What they don't do:**
- Interpret authority (they catalog it)
- Operate in real-time decision contexts
- Serve as primary work systems
- Design for domain-specific reasoning

**Assessment:** Strong at compliance documentation. Not designed for operational decision support.

---

### Category 3: Business Intelligence & Analytics

**Examples:** Tableau, Looker, Power BI, ThoughtSpot, Sigma

**What they do:**
- Visualize data
- Enable ad-hoc analysis
- Surface trends and patterns
- Democratize data access

**What they don't do:**
- Recommend decisions
- Capture decision rationale
- Anchor to authority
- Preserve provenance

**Assessment:** Strong at insight. Silent on action.

---

### Category 4: AI Assistants & Copilots

**Examples:** ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini

**What they do:**
- Generate text and code
- Answer questions
- Summarize documents
- Assist with drafting

**What they don't do:**
- Maintain context across sessions
- Anchor to authoritative sources
- Refuse when uncertain
- Produce auditable outputs

**Assessment:** Strong at generation. Weak on governance.

---

### Category 5: AI Agents & Automation

**Examples:** AutoGPT, AgentGPT, LangChain agents, various "agentic" startups

**What they do:**
- Execute multi-step tasks
- Chain actions autonomously
- Integrate with tools and APIs

**What they don't do:**
- Capture decisions (just actions)
- Preserve human accountability
- Reason about authority
- Learn judgment (just outcomes)

**Assessment:** Strong at automation. Potentially dangerous for accountability.

---

### Category 6: Operating System / Infrastructure Plays

**Examples:** EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), Scaling Up, various "business OS" tools

**What they do:**
- Provide operating frameworks
- Structure meetings and rhythms
- Define roles and accountability
- Enable execution discipline

**What they don't do (mostly):**
- Incorporate AI-native reasoning
- Capture decisions computationally
- Anchor to external authority
- Learn structurally

**Assessment:** Strong frameworks. Not AI-native.

## Emerging Competitors: Closer but Not There

A handful of emerging products approach decision infrastructure more directly:

### Convoking4
- **Claim:** Decision operating system for scaling companies
- **Overlap:** Decision → project governance; strategy → plan → execution layers
- **Gap:** Primarily execution governance, not authority-anchored reasoning

### PRISM OS
- **Claim:** Leader workspace for priorities and judgment support
- **Overlap:** AI-native; explicitly aims for graduation/reduced dependence
- **Gap:** Personal productivity focus; not licensable cross-company blueprint

### Dispatch
- **Claim:** Decision OS for high-performance leaders
- **Overlap:** Decision framing; throughput optimization
- **Gap:** Inbox/communication layer; not company-wide operating governance

### DecidrOS
- **Claim:** Platform for agentic organizations
- **Overlap:** OS language; governance controls
- **Gap:** Enterprise platform, not founder operating logic

### Rhythms
- **Claim:** AI for organizational rhythms and OKRs
- **Overlap:** Strategy to execution connection
- **Gap:** Goal tracking, not decision capture

**Assessment:** These represent the leading edge of adjacent innovation. None meets all five requirements for decision intelligence infrastructure.

## The Gap

What's missing from the market:

### 1. Authority-Anchored Reasoning
Systems that can trace recommendations to law, regulation, policy, terms—not just "best practices" or model outputs.

### 2. First-Class Refusal
Systems that know what they don't know and say so explicitly, rather than generating plausible but potentially wrong answers.

### 3. Decision Provenance
Audit trails that exist by default, capturing not just what happened but why, by whom, based on what authority.

### 4. Context Encoding
Structured capture of entity type, role, stage, jurisdiction, and other factors that change what answers are correct.

### 5. Structural Learning
Improvement from patterns and precedent, not just data volume. Learning that transfers across instances.

### 6. Substrate-Level Architecture
Not a feature, not a product—a layer that other applications can build on, with clean APIs and bounded ontologies.

## Category Assessment

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is this a crowded market? | **No.** Crowded *adjacent* markets; sparse direct competition. |
| Is this a new category? | **Subcategory.** Sits at intersection of decision OS, strategy-to-execution, and AI-native reasoning. |
| What distinguishes it? | Schema/logic guidance (not advice) + explicit graduation design |
| Who should build here? | Teams with governance depth + technical fluency + systems thinking |

## Implications

### For Incumbents
GRC and workflow vendors will attempt to add "AI" to their platforms. They face the retrofit problem: legacy architectures designed for different purposes cannot easily become decision intelligence infrastructure.

### For AI Labs
Foundation model companies are focused on model capability, not domain infrastructure. They will provide the reasoning engines but not the governance layer.

### For Startups
The opportunity is to define the category while it's still formable. First-mover advantage matters less than architectural correctness. The entity that builds decision intelligence infrastructure correctly—not first—will dominate.

### For Buyers
Be skeptical of "AI operating system" claims. Ask:
- Does it capture decisions or just tasks?
- Does it anchor to authority or just generate text?
- Does it refuse when uncertain?
- Does it preserve accountability?
- Does it learn structurally?

Most products will fail these tests. The few that pass represent a different category entirely.

---

## Conclusion

The market is crowded with products managing adjacent problems: tasks, compliance, analytics, generation.

The market is nearly empty for products solving the core problem: **infrastructure for human judgment at scale, with AI assistance, authority anchoring, and structural learning**.

This is not a feature gap. It's a category gap.

The infrastructure will be built. The question is by whom.

*The absence of competition is not evidence of no opportunity. It's evidence of no solution—yet.*
